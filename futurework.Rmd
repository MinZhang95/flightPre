# Shiny App

Imagine that we plan to attend JSM 2019 this summer, and we are so lazy that we don't want to drive...


Raw travel plan:

- Des Moines to Denver

# Future work

- Meet more customized requirements: 

    filter with class, transit stops, infants, and etc.

- Accumulated data: 

    temporal plot showing the price fluctuations. Diviniations may help us know when to buy the tickets with the lowest price!
